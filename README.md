# Raspberry Pi clock project

Originally inspired by [InkyPi](https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi) but I wanted something backlit.

Hardware:
- Raspberry pi 5 (because we had one)
- [Waveshare 5in LCD](https://www.waveshare.com/5inch-dsi-lcd-c.htm)

Software was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCzWkUX-qtY) and [this codepen](https://codepen.io/junxblah/pen/JojazXx)
